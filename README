# KyberCore ⚡🔦

KyberCore is a high-performance, modular lightsaber firmware designed for ESP32. It supports sound, motion effects, Neopixel animation, and robust hardware modularity — all built with ultra-low latency in mind.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Clone the repo **with submodules**:

> ⚠️ This is important! Without `--recurse-submodules`, required libraries won’t be included.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/KyberCore.git
```

Or if you already cloned without submodules:

```
cd KyberCore
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 📦 Additions / Contributions

If you're adding your own libraries inside lib/, please use either:

- Git submodules (preferred for external dependencies)
- Flat code (no .git/ folder inside) for static snapshots
